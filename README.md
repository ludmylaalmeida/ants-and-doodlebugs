<p>This code cannot be used for college assignments. I value keeping this code on github as part of my portfolio, but as you all know, _**plagiarism is bad**_. I spent a non-negligible amount of effort developing and designing this project and I am proud of it! All I ask is to not claim this effort as your own.</p>
